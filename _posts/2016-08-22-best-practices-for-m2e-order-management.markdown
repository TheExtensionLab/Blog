###Best Practices for M2E Order Management 
Magento is one of the most popular eCommerce platforms with more than 200,000 websites running on it. With its flexible cart option combined with a highly customisable interface, Magento's popularity among business owners is only growing. What makes this OpenSource software an especially versatile and dynamic tool is the plethora of extensions available at little or no extra cost.

If you are using Magento's Order Management System (OMS) to track all the orders placed on your site, [Order Status Colors](https://www.theextensionlab.com/order-status-colors) is a helpful extension to use. It allows you to colour-code the orders by their status to help you quickly visualise which orders have been fulfilled and which ones need your attention. While the M2E extension allows you to easily retail your products on Amazon, eBay, and Rakuten at no extra cost after $10,000 in sales a month, managing the logistics for orders across these platforms can become quite chaotic. With the Multi Store option on Order Status Colors, you can first colour-code orders by platform and then further categorise them depending on their processing stage. This option saves you the hassle of having to filter for a store and then check each order individually for its status. It gives you all the relevant, actionable information regarding the orders that you have to process and those that you have already fulfilled, across different platforms.

Order Status Colors also enables you to keep track of your business on the go. With your smartphone, you can easily access information regarding new orders, completed orders, and those that are already being processed. All of this data will be colour-coded based on order status, and hence very easy to grasp. These are just the basic functionalities of Order Status Colors. There are many other nifty ways in which it helps you streamline your workflow and logistics planning.

###Tracking different payment methods

While using Magento's Order Management System (OMS) for M2E, you can combine it with the Order Status Color extension to differentiate orders from each eCommerce platform by their status, as well as the payment method. Within each platform, you can use different colours to designate each payment method. This will help you track orders that have already been paid for and those that are yet to be paid for. For instance, if you accept different payment methods on eBay, you should have a separate order status for each of these methods. This will assist you in easily identifying payments made by personal check, cash on pickup, or money order on the Magento Order Management Screen.

###Managing Amazon orders
With Amazon, it is crucial to ship your products within the lead time you have already set. Therefore, it’s an excellent idea to have a specific Order Status for an unshipped or in-transit order specific to Amazon. Utilising the extension on M2E, you can customise Order Statuses for Amazon and eBay separately. You can then change the colour for each order status with the extension. These options will allow a merchant to quickly and easily identify items of high importance that need attention.

###Sorting multiple listings
If you sell your products on several eBay stores or have multiple Amazon listings, you can assign each store a customised order status and utilise different colour schemes for them. This will help you stay organised even as your orders grow across different platforms.

###  Organising drop shipping
If you drop ship products, managing the follow-ups and logistics can be quite a handful. It is important that you create separate listing templates for them with M2E and assign separate order statuses to these items. This will help you to quickly identify what needs your immediate attention.

A well-managed website and good overall online presence are crucial to the success of your eCommerce business. But, the magic you work behind the scenes - managing the inventory and organising the logistics for shipping - can help make your business sustainable. With the help of M2E and the Order Status Colors extension, you can easily access updated information and use it to streamline your back-end.
