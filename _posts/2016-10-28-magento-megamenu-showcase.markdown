##Magento MegaMenu Showcase

So our [MegaMenu extension for Magento](https://github.com/TheExtensionLab/MegaMenu) was released roughly 1 year now - since that time it's been awesome to see the great designs our customers have been able to pull off using our extension as a base. Today I wanted to share a few examples of their great work and showcase what is possible with our extension.

The examples below are in action on live websites - so please, go check them out!
